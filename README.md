# Platform for training emergency medical skills

This project presents the development of the interactive web platform for training emergency medical skills. The platform is built using modern technologies such as Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL and Docker. Users can take educational courses, perform emergency situation simulations and use a fast search including voice input. The original feature of the project is the implementation of interactive simulations with step-by-step video guidance for real emergency medical scenarios, which brings the learning process as close as possible to real-life conditions. The work includes an analysis of the topic’s relevance, a description of the architecture, database structure, main client and server components, as well as the results of platform performance testing. Special attention is paid to user convenience, security and the potential for further system development.
